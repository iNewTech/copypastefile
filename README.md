# copypastefile

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides two convenient commands for handling files:

## Features

*   **Duplicate File**: Creates a copy of the selected file in the same directory. It automatically suggests a new file name (e.g., `filename_copy.ext`) and allows you to modify it before creation.
*   **Copy File Content**: Copies the entire content of the selected file to the clipboard.

## Usage

You can use these commands in two ways:

1.  **From the Explorer**: Right-click on a file in the Explorer view to open the context menu. You will find "Duplicate File" and "Copy File Content" in the menu.
2.  **From the Editor**: Right-click inside an open editor to open the context menu. You will also find the commands there.
